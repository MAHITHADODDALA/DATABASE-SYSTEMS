# DATABASE-SYSTEMS
I created a Website for "KU Tutoring services" using MYSQL, PHP, HTML . This website acts as a platform between KU Tutors and Students.                
Unzip the project zip folder to view php,html files of this project. 
Open the browser and type "people.eecs.ku.edu/~mdoddala/dbconnect.php",which connects my database to the web server.
Then type "people.eecs.ku.edu/~mdoddala/loginpage.php" which asks for student name and KU ID of the student.
For example enter student name as KATIE and student KUID as 2787070.
From this page you will be automatically directed to the next pages till you get a "CONFIRMATION" Page.
